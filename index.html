    <p>
      This isn't the responsive blog, as you can see. That can be found
      <a href="https://respdev.com/blog">here</a> (or on the other site
      <a href="https://other.respdev.com/blog">here</a>).

      Instead, this just allows us (and you) to access the JSON Feed
      files found under the <code>dist/</code> directory. Otherwise,
      CORS would do its magic and prevent us.
