{"title":"Events Suck; Let's Change That!","description":"Yet another change for the better","date":"2021-07-03T01:05:50.622Z","authors":[{"name":"Leon","link":"https://other.respdev.com"}],"slug":"events-suck","content":"***A quick note**: We really wanted to get this out as quick as we could as it\r\nis a big update. Sorry for any mistakes you see or weird sentence structures,\r\nwe were just excited!*\r\n\r\n# Out with the Old\r\n\r\nSo we've all seen the events, a friendly competition to create something in a\r\ngiven timeframe and possibly get voted 1st place by the community. **Let's be\r\nhonest, they sucked, a lot**. But why?\r\n\r\n## Boring Ideas\r\n\r\nNot once did we have an event idea that sounded - fun. Every idea felt like a\r\nrun of the mill browser search for *fun projects to do in X language*. We want\r\nto change that, and so we will be asking **you** for **your** amazing ideas\r\nmore often.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at it, it's almost like we forgot that we were a community for\r\na second there, so let's fix that!\r\n\r\n## Not Everyone is Competitive\r\n\r\nThere are only really two reasons people compete in a challenge:\r\n\r\n- **they're competitive**,\r\n- or **there's something to be won**.\r\n\r\n**Unfortunately, we're broke**; the second option was never something we could\r\ndo even if we wanted to - *apart from the Nitro that one time*. And also **most\r\npeople aren't the competitive type**, so we need a better format than this.\r\n\r\n## Scheduling\r\n\r\n**You** have things to do, and so do we. **A week is not long enough** for\r\npeople to get a, *sometimes medium sized*, project done. This is especially\r\ntrue when said project **doesn't excite you** and is, for all intents and\r\npurposes, a *side project*.\r\n\r\n## Involvement\r\n\r\n**Not many people got involved, and we don't blame you**. The events were\r\nboring, never fit anyone's schedule, and didn't even have a reward (*like most\r\nevents!*). **It's not on you that we didn't provide fun events, that's our\r\nproblem and we want to fix it...**\r\n\r\n# In with the New\r\n\r\nSo we've been thinking of a **whole new system to fully replace events** once\r\nthe **Verselet x Responsive MiniGolf** event finishes (*that one should\r\nactually be good fun for you competitive types*). Hopefully we can get it right\r\nthis time so that everyone has the most fun possible.\r\n\r\n## Monthly Themes\r\n\r\n**Monthly themes** is the new idea; we say *monthly* but this might change as\r\nwe learn more about how everyone interacts with them. How they work is that **a\r\ntheme gets announced** and **you can decide if and when you want to give it a\r\ngo**. You can **give past themes a try** if you want, it's up to you.\r\n\r\nThe whole rationale is for it to act more like an **idea to get you started\r\ninstead of constraints that ruin your creativity**. You might make something big\r\nfrom the idea, a little example, or nothing at all; **it's all up to you**.\r\n\r\n## Sharing Your Projects\r\n\r\nThe great thing is that **everyone can see what you've made**, we'll be setting\r\nup a system for you to be able to add your project to the list! **If we see\r\nsomething we really like we'll feature it in a blog post, or you may want to\r\nwrite your own blog post about it to be shared here**!\r\n\r\n## A New Leaf\r\n\r\nWe hope that this time we can make something enjoyable for everyone. As always,\r\nyour feedback is greatly appreciated, feel free to `@Leonski` or `@TheDevBird`\r\nin the **discord** or email us at responsivedev@pm.me.\r\n\r\nThanks for being such an amazing community!"}
