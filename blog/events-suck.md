***A quick note**: We really wanted to get this out as quick as we could as it
is a big update. Sorry for any mistakes you see or weird sentence structures,
we were just excited!*

# Update: First Monthly Theme!

You can find the event [here](/blog/the-first-theme)!

# Out with the Old

So we've all seen the events, a friendly competition to create something in a
given timeframe and possibly get voted 1st place by the community. **Let's be
honest, they sucked, a lot**. But why?

## Boring Ideas

Not once did we have an event idea that sounded - fun. Every idea felt like a
run of the mill browser search for *fun projects to do in X language*. We want
to change that, and so we will be asking **you** for **your** amazing ideas
more often.

When you look at it, it's almost like we forgot that we were a community for
a second there, so let's fix that!

## Not Everyone is Competitive

There are only really two reasons people compete in a challenge:

- **they're competitive**,
- or **there's something to be won**.

**Unfortunately, we're broke**; the second option was never something we could
do even if we wanted to - *apart from the Nitro that one time*. And also **most
people aren't the competitive type**, so we need a better format than this.

## Scheduling

**You** have things to do, and so do we. **A week is not long enough** for
people to get a, *sometimes medium sized*, project done. This is especially
true when said project **doesn't excite you** and is, for all intents and
purposes, a *side project*.

## Involvement

**Not many people got involved, and we don't blame you**. The events were
boring, never fit anyone's schedule, and didn't even have a reward (*like most
events!*). **It's not on you that we didn't provide fun events, that's our
problem and we want to fix it...**

# In with the New

So we've been thinking of a **whole new system to fully replace events** once
the **Verselet x Responsive MiniGolf** event finishes (*that one should
actually be good fun for you competitive types*). Hopefully we can get it right
this time so that everyone has the most fun possible.

## Monthly Themes

**Monthly themes** is the new idea; we say *monthly* but this might change as
we learn more about how everyone interacts with them. How they work is that **a
theme gets announced** and **you can decide if and when you want to give it a
go**. You can **give past themes a try** if you want, it's up to you.

The whole rationale is for it to act more like an **idea to get you started
instead of constraints that ruin your creativity**. You might make something big
from the idea, a little example, or nothing at all; **it's all up to you**.

## Sharing Your Projects

The great thing is that **everyone can see what you've made**, we'll be setting
up a system for you to be able to add your project to the list! **If we see
something we really like we'll feature it in a blog post, or you may want to
write your own blog post about it to be shared here**!

## A New Leaf

We hope that this time we can make something enjoyable for everyone. As always,
your feedback is greatly appreciated, feel free to `@Leonski` or `@TheDevBird`
in the **discord** or email us at responsivedev@pm.me.

Thanks for being such an amazing community!
