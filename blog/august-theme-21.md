Hey everyone! I apologize for the delay in releasing the monthly theme for August. I'll do better next time!

# Basis
For this theme, we want participants to utilize communication methods such as web sockets, HTTP, TCP, WebRTC, etc. Anything that involves moving information from one system to another counts!

We recommend to use real-time or polling methods (because they're fun), but it's not required

# Submitting
To submit your project for a chance to be featured on our site (I know right?!), just put a link to it in the [#share](https://discord.com/channels/753992573743399023/788869046119563345) channel and ping @TheDevBird.
