This is just a quick little mini blog post for the first **theme**, and since
it's the first one I'll go over a few things so that we're all clear.

# The Theme

The first **theme** is **filesystems**! You may create a virtual filesystem for
the web, a little file explorer for the terminal, or something else entierly!

We hope that you enjoy the new system! The projects area on the website hasn't
yet been implemented so stay tuned for that when it releases.

Have fun!
